### Quick Background

I am a student at Boston University (BU) where I am working on completing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Data Analytics.

My degree at BU will be a little longer than a normal Master's program. Until 2021, I was a chemist. I studied chemistry at Stonehill College and worked at PerkinElmer Health Sciences afterwards, but realized I wanted to work in a different field in the long-term. Instead of gradually making up some classes to enroll directly in a Master's program at BU, I started as a LEAP student at BU ([LEAP program](https://engineering.bu.edu/leap-lp/)). After a couple semesters of "catch up" courses, I will be starting as a Master's candidate with other computer engineering students pursuing a Master's degree.

### Interests

I feel like I am still just beginning to uncover what I want to work on in the long-term because there is still lots to learn about modern analytics and the future of the field.

That being said, I decided to start at BU because I was enthralled with the modern uses of data. I noticed this in particular through sports analytics since I was an athlete when I was younger and continue to follow many professional sports.

In my free-time, I prioritize learning Python and R as well as fundamental principles of statistics. Simultaneously, I try to educate myself on the current efforts in data analytics to understand where the future of the field is heading and to decide what kind of future work I will do with my new skills.

### I'm currently working on...

My focus right now is to do many projects that demonstrate what I am learning in Python and R. My courses at BU, so far and in the immediate future, are slightly generic computer engineering courses, which primarily ask the students to use C, C++, and MATLAB. The focused data analytics courses will be a bigger part of my Master's program. However, I will focus on the learning the skills of the data analytics dogma for my personal work.

### I'm currently learning...

I am learning probability and statistics, Python, R, and machine learning on my personal time for my personal projects.

My current classes at BU focus on probability and statistics (MATLAB), more fundamental mathematics, algorithms and data structures (C++), and computer logic and design.
