### Quick Background

I am a student at Boston University (BU) where I am working on completing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Data Analytics.

My degree at BU will be a little longer than a normal Master's program. Until 2021, I was a chemist. I studied chemistry at Stonehill College and worked at PerkinElmer Health Sciences afterwards, but realized I wanted to work in a different field in the long-term. Instead of gradually making up some classes to enroll directly in a Master's program at BU, I started as a LEAP student at BU ([LEAP program](https://engineering.bu.edu/leap-lp/)). After a couple semesters of "catch up" courses, I will be starting as a Master's candidate with other computer engineering students pursuing a Master's degree.

### Interests

I feel like I am still just beginning to uncover what I want to work on in the long-term because there is still lots to learn about modern analytics and the future of the field.

That being said, I decided to start at BU because I was fascinated by the amount of information available and the insights that I was seeing from data. I noticed this in particular through sports since I was an athlete when I was younger and continue to follow many professional sports.

In my free-time, I enjoy playing with and learning from data - mostly sports data. You will find that a lot of the open-ended work here is of this nature.

However, my professional interests are more focused on applying engineering to data-driven projects. I am excited about software development as it pertains to efficient movement and transformation of data in support of machine learning and data science.

### I'm currently working on...

My focus right now is demonstrating through practice what I am learning. 

My courses at BU are great for learning foundational concepts and approaches to problem solving, and I work on putting this into practice whenever I get the chance.

My courses at BU have primarily focused on data structures, algorithms, probability, statistics, and machine learning in C/C++ and MATLAB. To gain experience, I build in some time to learn additional skills through courses and tutorials on the web. Since I can tailor the "ciriculum," I can pick and choose lessons that I believe will be valuable based on my interests and future jobs that appeal to me.

### I'm currently learning...

__Machine Learning__ - Since this is a major element of modern work with data, I believe it is extremely important to be proficient in the topic. I am currently taking a course in ML (and plan to take a Deep Learning course through BU), and practice implementing models on personal projects to understand how data must be prepared and used.

__Cloud Computing & Distributed Systems__ - I am really excited to continue learning about this topic right now. As I have become more comfortable with software and computer engineering, the topics have become more appealing. I am excited to focus on the foundational skills of this field through my coursework, and I try to learn as much own my own as possible. On my own, I follow courses and tutorials on cloud computing tools and providers (many listed below) so that I can confidently implement techniques that I have and contiue to learn in distributed environments.

A Short List of Specific Skills
* SQL
* Apache Spark & PySpark
* Hadoop
* Apache Airflow
* AWS (S3, EC2, and RDS) - via AWS Training Site


### What I have learned and plan to using and learning...
This includes courses that I have taken at BU as well as topics that I have learned on my own.

* Algorithms
* C/C++
* Python
* probability and statistics
* Data Structures
* Data Visualization - matplotlib, seaborn, and (some) ggplot2
* Operating Systems
